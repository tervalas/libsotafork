# libsotafork
A fork of catweazle's libsota library for Shroud of the Avatar incorporating new UI structure

Contains updated BETA versions of both libsota.lua and libsota.util.lua.

WARNING: Not all new code has been tested fully. I do not use every new feature but will do my best to update as I can.

ITEMS DEFINITELY NEEDED TO BE ADDED/CHANGED:

  Object Mouse Resizing Tracking/Effects
  
  Input Box Text Setting (possible bug with SOTA code)
  
  Object Stacking (affects CreateLabelWithShadow at the moment which looks 'odd' under current implementation)
